# Hyperloop

**A new evolution in the voxel word:**

## Minetest goes Hyperloop!

* It allows travelling from point point in seconds (900 km/h) :-)
* Hyperloop tubes can be build in teamwork together with other players
* It can be used even on small servers (Raspberry PI) without lagging
* No configuration or programming of the tube network is necessary (only the station names have to be entered)

The mod includes many different blocks for the tubes, the junctions, the stations, the pod, the ticket/booking machine and the map. It also includes a WiFi tube block for very large distances (admin feature).



## Introduction

Connect two Junction blocks with a line of Tube blocks. The tube itself is automatically protected. You can dig only the ends of a tube line (head blocks). The junction block / station has to be protected by manually.

A Junction block, which is the basis for a station, can have up to four tubes. That means you can build complex networks of tube lines. Each junction/station can be reaches from each point with on trip.

To build a station, give the Junction block a unique station name and place the Pod Seat on top of it.

Build the pod around the seat according to the following picture. To get the best illusion of traveling, it is important that all pods are look the same from the inside.

The pod shell is not important for the function, the minimal equipment for testing is: the Tube line with Junction Blocks, a Pod Seat on each station, the Display in front of the seat, and the Booking Machine. The Booking Machine has to get the same station name as the Junction block and has to be placed nearby the Junction block (max. 20 blocks difference).

Keep a hole for the door which will be placed automatically when you start your first trip. The door hole has always to be on the left side of the pod (see the following picture).
