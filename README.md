# Hyperloop

**A new evolution in the voxel word:**

## Minetest goes Hyperloop!

* It allows travelling from point point in seconds (900 km/h) :-)
* Hyperloop tubes can be build in teamwork together with other players
* It can be used even on small servers (Raspberry PI) without lagging
* No configuration or programming of the tube network is necessary (only the station names have to be entered)

The mod includes many different blocks for the tubes, the junctions, the stations, the pod, the ticket/booking machine and the map tool. It also includes a WiFi tube block for very large distances (admin feature).
