# Hyperloop

**A new evolution in the voxel word:**

## Minetest goes Hyperloop!

The fast and modern way of traveling.
* Hyperloop allows travelling from point point in seconds (900 km/h) :-)
* Hyperloop tubes can be build in teamwork together with other players
* It can be used even on small servers (Raspberry PI) without lagging
* No configuration or programming of the tube network is necessary (only the station names have to be entered)

The mod includes many different blocks for tubes, junctions, stations, elevators, ticket/booking machine, map tool, station builder, tube robot, and some signs and decoration blocks. It also includes WiFi tube blocks for very large distances (admin feature).

## Introduction

Hyperloop is passenger transportation system for travelling through evacuated tubes my means of passenger pods.
The tubes system with all stations and pods have to be build by the players.

The pods can reach a maximum speed of up to 900 km/h. This requires a tube system on one level. That means all stations from one network have to be on the same level. Therefore, Hyperloop provides an elevator system to reach the station in the underground or in the air, depending on the tube level.

To build a first route with 2 station, craft and place two Hyperloop Station Blocks, add items to the Station Block to build  the Station Pod, place a Booking Machines nearby both stations, and connect the stations by means of Hyperloop Tube blocks. You can use the Hyperloop Tube Robot to simplify the job. 


**Some additional facts:**

The tube route is automatically protected. You can dig only the ends of a tube line (head blocks). The junction block / station has to be protected manually.

Junction and Station Blocks can connect up to four tube lines. That means you can build complex networks of tube lines. Each junction/station can be reaches from each point with one trip.


## Still To Do

* Admin tool to interrupt tube routes
