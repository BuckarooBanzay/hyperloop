# Hyperloop

**A new evolution in the voxel word:**

## Minetest goes Hyperloop!

The fast and modern way of traveling.
* Hyperloop allows travelling from point point in seconds (900 km/h) :-)
* Hyperloop tubes can be build in teamwork together with other players
* It can be used even on small servers (Raspberry PI) without lagging
* No configuration or programming of the tube network is necessary (only the station names have to be entered)

The mod includes many different kind of blocks:
- Hyperloop Stations Block to automatically build the pod/car
- Hyperloop Booking Machine for the station to select the destination
- Hyperloop Tube to connect two stations
- Hyperloop Junction Block to connect up to 4 tubes for complex network structures
- Hyperloop Tube Robot to automatically build tubes
- Hyperloop Stations Sign
- Hyperloop Promo Poster for station advertisement
- Hyperloop Elevator to reach other levels
- Hyperloop Elevator Shaft to connect two elevator cars 
- Hyperloop Station Book with all available stations (for builders/engineers)
- Hyperloop Tube Crowbar to crack tube lines (for admins)
- Hyperloop WiFi Tubes for very large distances (admin feature)
..and more.

## Introduction

Hyperloop is passenger transportation system for travelling through evacuated tubes my means of passenger pods.
The tubes system with all stations and pods have to be build by the players.


**Some additional facts:**

The tube route is automatically protected. You can dig only the ends of a tube line (head blocks). The junction block / station has to be protected manually.
There is an admin tool available to crack tube lines.

Junction and Station Blocks can connect up to four tube lines. That means you can build complex networks of tube lines. Each junction/station can be reaches from each point with one trip.


## Still To Do

* find some bugs
